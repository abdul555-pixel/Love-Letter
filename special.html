                <p>Happy Birthday Mohtarma… Meeting you is one of the best things happened in my life. You showed me something different… Something I never felt before. I’m grateful to have you and I don’t want to lose you. The truth is yes I’m a little obsessed and biased towards you… because of your smile… your eyes… the way you make me feel all the love and care… You filled me with so much peace. I’m sorry If I annoy you too much.
                I want you to be the happiest person in this universe because you deserve it… because you are pure… because you have a kind soul. I know all this might sound cringe but this is what I feel like saying at this moment. Even if we don’t stay together in the future because of whatever reason… you will still be the closest to my heart.</p>
